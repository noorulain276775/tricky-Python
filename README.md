- Custom iterator classes and protocols

**Key Concepts:** Lazy evaluation, memory efficiency, iteration protocols, coroutines

## How to Use for Exams

### **For Students:**
1. **Run each file** to see the output
2. **Try to predict the output** before running
3. **Study the explanations** in the code comments
4. **Practice writing similar examples** from scratch

### **For Teachers:**
1. **Use individual files** for specific topic exams
2. **Ask students to predict outputs** for specific examples
3. **Create variations** based on the provided patterns
4. **Use for discussion** about Python internals and best practices

### **For Interview Preparation:**
1. **Master each concept** thoroughly
2. **Understand the "why"** behind each behavior
3. **Practice explaining** the concepts clearly
4. **Learn to spot** these patterns in real code

## Example Types Included

- **Scope and Variable Issues**
- **Mutable vs Immutable Behavior**
- **Function and Lambda Gotchas**
- **Iterator and Generator Patterns**
- **Advanced Unpacking Techniques**
- **Functional Programming Concepts**
- **Object-Oriented Pitfalls**
- **Performance Considerations**

## Why These Examples Are Tricky

These examples demonstrate Python behaviors that often confuse even experienced developers:

- **Late binding** in closures and loops
- **Mutable default arguments** that persist between calls
- **Shallow vs deep copying** of nested structures
- **Iterator exhaustion** and generator state
- **Extended unpacking** with complex patterns
- **Lambda capture** of loop variables

## Learning Benefits

By studying these examples, you'll:

- **Deepen your Python knowledge** beyond basic syntax
- **Avoid common bugs** in production code
- **Write more efficient** and Pythonic code
- **Excel in technical interviews** and coding challenges
- **Understand Python internals** and design decisions

## Running the Examples

```bash
# Navigate to any directory and run the Python file
cd listComprehension
python list_comprehension_tricks.py

# Or run from the root directory
python listComprehension/list_comprehension_tricks.py
```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+** (some features require newer versions)
- **Basic Python knowledge** (variables, functions, loops)
- **Understanding of data types** (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
